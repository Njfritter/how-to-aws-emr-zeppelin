#### [Find out how.](https://sbchapin.github.io/how-to-aws-emr-zeppelin/)

This is the code repository for **[a guide](https://sbchapin.github.io/how-to-aws-emr-zeppelin/)** on how to set up and use [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) on [AWS EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/), from scratch.

This is designed to be both a **presentation**, **tool**, and **documentation**.  Following **[this guide](https://sbchapin.github.io/how-to-aws-emr-zeppelin/)** will get you from 0 to 84 _([seriously](http://www.airships.net/hindenburg/size-speed/), the hindenberg could go 84 mph)_ in just about the amount of time it takes to get the inside of a hot pocket boiling lava hot _(not long)_.
